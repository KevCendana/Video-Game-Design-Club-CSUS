## Creation Process
As the sole developer for this project, I wanted to create a website that would be easy to navigate and visually appealing while maintaining the spirit of VGDC. 
1) <b>Planning:</b> Collaborating with the club president, I gathered information about the club and its members to create a website that would be informative and engaging. We discussed the layout, color scheme, and content that would be included on the website.
2) <b>Wireframe:</b> I started by creating a template for the website using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LI6Q4u6401fMTQWcKTu3qJ/Video-Game-Design-Club?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=AWG65BI3JjSkovnE-1)
 to plan out the layout and design of the website.
3) <b>Development:</b> I used Angular to create the website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS. I used the wireframe as a guide to create the layout and design of the website.
4) <b>Hosting:</b> Currently in progress, but I plan to host the website on Netlify if there
